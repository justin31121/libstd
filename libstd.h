/* miniz.c 3.0.0 - public domain deflate/inflate, zlib-subset, ZIP reading/writing/appending, PNG writing
   See "unlicense" statement at the end of this file.
   Rich Geldreich <richgel99@gmail.com>, last updated Oct. 13, 2013
   Implements RFC 1950: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1950.txt and RFC 1951: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1951.txt

   Most API's defined in miniz.c are optional. For example, to disable the archive related functions just define
   MINIZ_NO_ARCHIVE_APIS, or to get rid of all stdio usage define MINIZ_NO_STDIO (see the list below for more macros).

   * Low-level Deflate/Inflate implementation notes:

     Compression: Use the "tdefl" API's. The compressor supports raw, static, and dynamic blocks, lazy or
     greedy parsing, match length filtering, RLE-only, and Huffman-only streams. It performs and compresses
     approximately as well as zlib.

     Decompression: Use the "tinfl" API's. The entire decompressor is implemented as a single function
     coroutine: see tinfl_decompress(). It supports decompression into a 32KB (or larger power of 2) wrapping buffer, or into a memory
     block large enough to hold the entire file.

     The low-level tdefl/tinfl API's do not make any use of dynamic memory allocation.

   * zlib-style API notes:

     miniz.c implements a fairly large subset of zlib. There's enough functionality present for it to be a drop-in
     zlib replacement in many apps:
        The z_stream struct, optional memory allocation callbacks
        deflateInit/deflateInit2/deflate/deflateReset/deflateEnd/deflateBound
        inflateInit/inflateInit2/inflate/inflateReset/inflateEnd
        compress, compress2, compressBound, uncompress
        CRC-32, Adler-32 - Using modern, minimal code size, CPU cache friendly routines.
        Supports raw deflate streams or standard zlib streams with adler-32 checking.

     Limitations:
      The callback API's are not implemented yet. No support for gzip headers or zlib static dictionaries.
      I've tried to closely emulate zlib's various flavors of stream flushing and return status codes, but
      there are no guarantees that miniz.c pulls this off perfectly.

   * PNG writing: See the tdefl_write_image_to_png_file_in_memory() function, originally written by
     Alex Evans. Supports 1-4 bytes/pixel images.

   * ZIP archive API notes:

     The ZIP archive API's where designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind, with just enough abstraction to
     get the job done with minimal fuss. There are simple API's to retrieve file information, read files from
     existing archives, create new archives, append new files to existing archives, or clone archive data from
     one archive to another. It supports archives located in memory or the heap, on disk (using stdio.h),
     or you can specify custom file read/write callbacks.

     - Archive reading: Just call this function to read a single file from a disk archive:

      void *mz_zip_extract_archive_file_to_heap(const char *pZip_filename, const char *pArchive_name,
        size_t *pSize, mz_uint zip_flags);

     For more complex cases, use the "mz_zip_reader" functions. Upon opening an archive, the entire central
     directory is located and read as-is into memory, and subsequent file access only occurs when reading individual files.

     - Archives file scanning: The simple way is to use this function to scan a loaded archive for a specific file:

     int mz_zip_reader_locate_file(mz_zip_archive *pZip, const char *pName, const char *pComment, mz_uint flags);

     The locate operation can optionally check file comments too, which (as one example) can be used to identify
     multiple versions of the same file in an archive. This function uses a simple linear search through the central
     directory, so it's not very fast.

     Alternately, you can iterate through all the files in an archive (using mz_zip_reader_get_num_files()) and
     retrieve detailed info on each file by calling mz_zip_reader_file_stat().

     - Archive creation: Use the "mz_zip_writer" functions. The ZIP writer immediately writes compressed file data
     to disk and builds an exact image of the central directory in memory. The central directory image is written
     all at once at the end of the archive file when the archive is finalized.

     The archive writer can optionally align each file's local header and file data to any power of 2 alignment,
     which can be useful when the archive will be read from optical media. Also, the writer supports placing
     arbitrary data blobs at the very beginning of ZIP archives. Archives written using either feature are still
     readable by any ZIP tool.

     - Archive appending: The simple way to add a single file to an archive is to call this function:

      mz_bool mz_zip_add_mem_to_archive_file_in_place(const char *pZip_filename, const char *pArchive_name,
        const void *pBuf, size_t buf_size, const void *pComment, mz_uint16 comment_size, mz_uint level_and_flags);

     The archive will be created if it doesn't already exist, otherwise it'll be appended to.
     Note the appending is done in-place and is not an atomic operation, so if something goes wrong
     during the operation it's possible the archive could be left without a central directory (although the local
     file headers and file data will be fine, so the archive will be recoverable).

     For more complex archive modification scenarios:
     1. The safest way is to use a mz_zip_reader to read the existing archive, cloning only those bits you want to
     preserve into a new archive using using the mz_zip_writer_add_from_zip_reader() function (which compiles the
     compressed file data as-is). When you're done, delete the old archive and rename the newly written archive, and
     you're done. This is safe but requires a bunch of temporary disk space or heap memory.

     2. Or, you can convert an mz_zip_reader in-place to an mz_zip_writer using mz_zip_writer_init_from_reader(),
     append new files as needed, then finalize the archive which will write an updated central directory to the
     original archive. (This is basically what mz_zip_add_mem_to_archive_file_in_place() does.) There's a
     possibility that the archive's central directory could be lost with this method if anything goes wrong, though.

     - ZIP archive support limitations:
     No spanning support. Extraction functions can only handle unencrypted, stored or deflated files.
     Requires streams capable of seeking.

   * This is a header file library, like stb_image.c. To get only a header file, either cut and paste the
     below header, or create miniz.h, #define MINIZ_HEADER_FILE_ONLY, and then include miniz.c from it.

   * Important: For best perf. be sure to customize the below macros for your target platform:
     #define MINIZ_USE_UNALIGNED_LOADS_AND_STORES 1
     #define MINIZ_LITTLE_ENDIAN 1
     #define MINIZ_HAS_64BIT_REGISTERS 1

   * On platforms using glibc, Be sure to "#define _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE 1" before including miniz.c to ensure miniz
     uses the 64-bit variants: fopen64(), stat64(), etc. Otherwise you won't be able to process large files
     (i.e. 32-bit stat() fails for me on files > 0x7FFFFFFF bytes).

   QUICK NOTES:
      Primarily of interest to game developers and other people who can
          avoid problematic images and only need the trivial interface

      JPEG baseline & progressive (12 bpc/arithmetic not supported, same as stock IJG lib)
      PNG 1/2/4/8/16-bit-per-channel

      TGA (not sure what subset, if a subset)
      BMP non-1bpp, non-RLE
      PSD (composited view only, no extra channels, 8/16 bit-per-channel)

      GIF (*comp always reports as 4-channel)
      HDR (radiance rgbE format)
      PIC (Softimage PIC)
      PNM (PPM and PGM binary only)

      Animated GIF still needs a proper API, but here's one way to do it:
          http://gist.github.com/urraka/685d9a6340b26b830d49

      - decode from memory or through FILE (define STBI_NO_STDIO to remove code)
      - decode from arbitrary I/O callbacks
      - SIMD acceleration on x86/x64 (SSE2) and ARM (NEON)

#ifndef STBI_INCLUDE_STB_IMAGE_H
#define STBI_INCLUDE_STB_IMAGE_H

// DOCUMENTATION
//
// Limitations:
//    - no 12-bit-per-channel JPEG
//    - no JPEGs with arithmetic coding
//    - GIF always returns *comp=4
//
// Basic usage (see HDR discussion below for HDR usage):
//    int x,y,n;
//    unsigned char *data = stbi_load(filename, &x, &y, &n, 0);
//    // ... process data if not NULL ...
//    // ... x = width, y = height, n = # 8-bit components per pixel ...
//    // ... replace '0' with '1'..'4' to force that many components per pixel
//    // ... but 'n' will always be the number that it would have been if you said 0
//    stbi_image_free(data)
//
// Standard parameters:
//    int *x                 -- outputs image width in pixels
//    int *y                 -- outputs image height in pixels
//    int *channels_in_file  -- outputs # of image components in image file
//    int desired_channels   -- if non-zero, # of image components requested in result
//
// The return value from an image loader is an 'unsigned char *' which points
// to the pixel data, or NULL on an allocation failure or if the image is
// corrupt or invalid. The pixel data consists of *y scanlines of *x pixels,
// with each pixel consisting of N interleaved 8-bit components; the first
// pixel pointed to is top-left-most in the image. There is no padding between
// image scanlines or between pixels, regardless of format. The number of
// components N is 'desired_channels' if desired_channels is non-zero, or
// *channels_in_file otherwise. If desired_channels is non-zero,
// *channels_in_file has the number of components that _would_ have been
// output otherwise. E.g. if you set desired_channels to 4, you will always
// get RGBA output, but you can check *channels_in_file to see if it's trivially
// opaque because e.g. there were only 3 channels in the source image.
//
// An output image with N components has the following components interleaved
// in this order in each pixel:
//
//     N=#comp     components
//       1           grey
//       2           grey, alpha
//       3           red, green, blue
//       4           red, green, blue, alpha
//
// If image loading fails for any reason, the return value will be NULL,
// and *x, *y, *channels_in_file will be unchanged. The function
// stbi_failure_reason() can be queried for an extremely brief, end-user
// unfriendly explanation of why the load failed. Define STBI_NO_FAILURE_STRINGS
// to avoid compiling these strings at all, and STBI_FAILURE_USERMSG to get slightly
// more user-friendly ones.
//
// Paletted PNG, BMP, GIF, and PIC images are automatically depalettized.
//
// To query the width, height and component count of an image without having to
// decode the full file, you can use the stbi_info family of functions:
//
//   int x,y,n,ok;
//   ok = stbi_info(filename, &x, &y, &n);
//   // returns ok=1 and sets x, y, n if image is a supported format,
//   // 0 otherwise.
//
// Note that stb_image pervasively uses ints in its public API for sizes,
// including sizes of memory buffers. This is now part of the API and thus
// hard to change without causing breakage. As a result, the various image
// loaders all have certain limits on image size; these differ somewhat
// by format but generally boil down to either just under 2GB or just under
// 1GB. When the decoded image would be larger than this, stb_image decoding
// will fail.
//
// Additionally, stb_image will reject image files that have any of their
// dimensions set to a larger value than the configurable STBI_MAX_DIMENSIONS,
// which defaults to 2**24 = 16777216 pixels. Due to the above memory limit,
// the only way to have an image with such dimensions load correctly
// is for it to have a rather extreme aspect ratio. Either way, the
// assumption here is that such larger images are likely to be malformed
// or malicious. If you do need to load an image with individual dimensions
// larger than that, and it still fits in the overall size limit, you can
// #define STBI_MAX_DIMENSIONS on your own to be something larger.
//
// ===========================================================================
//
// UNICODE:
//
//   If compiling for Windows and you wish to use Unicode filenames, compile
//   with
//       #define STBI_WINDOWS_UTF8
//   and pass utf8-encoded filenames. Call stbi_convert_wchar_to_utf8 to convert
//   Windows wchar_t filenames to utf8.
//
// ===========================================================================
//
// Philosophy
//
// stb libraries are designed with the following priorities:
//
//    1. easy to use
//    2. easy to maintain
//    3. good performance
//
// Sometimes I let "good performance" creep up in priority over "easy to maintain",
// and for best performance I may provide less-easy-to-use APIs that give higher
// performance, in addition to the easy-to-use ones. Nevertheless, it's important
// to keep in mind that from the standpoint of you, a client of this library,
// all you care about is #1 and #3, and stb libraries DO NOT emphasize #3 above all.
//
// Some secondary priorities arise directly from the first two, some of which
// provide more explicit reasons why performance can't be emphasized.
//
//    - Portable ("ease of use")
//    - Small source code footprint ("easy to maintain")
//    - No dependencies ("ease of use")
//
// ===========================================================================
//
// I/O callbacks
//
// I/O callbacks allow you to read from arbitrary sources, like packaged
// files or some other source. Data read from callbacks are processed
// through a small internal buffer (currently 128 bytes) to try to reduce
// overhead.
//
// The three functions you must define are "read" (reads some bytes of data),
// "skip" (skips some bytes of data), "eof" (reports if the stream is at the end).
//
// ===========================================================================
//
// SIMD support
//
// The JPEG decoder will try to automatically use SIMD kernels on x86 when
// supported by the compiler. For ARM Neon support, you must explicitly
// request it.
//
// (The old do-it-yourself SIMD API is no longer supported in the current
// code.)
//
// On x86, SSE2 will automatically be used when available based on a run-time
// test; if not, the generic C versions are used as a fall-back. On ARM targets,
// the typical path is to have separate builds for NEON and non-NEON devices
// (at least this is true for iOS and Android). Therefore, the NEON support is
// toggled by a build flag: define STBI_NEON to get NEON loops.
//
// If for some reason you do not want to use any of SIMD code, or if
// you have issues compiling it, you can disable it entirely by
// defining STBI_NO_SIMD.
//
// ===========================================================================
//
// HDR image support   (disable by defining STBI_NO_HDR)
//
// stb_image supports loading HDR images in general, and currently the Radiance
// .HDR file format specifically. You can still load any file through the existing
// interface; if you attempt to load an HDR file, it will be automatically remapped
// to LDR, assuming gamma 2.2 and an arbitrary scale factor defaulting to 1;
// both of these constants can be reconfigured through this interface:
//
//     stbi_hdr_to_ldr_gamma(2.2f);
//     stbi_hdr_to_ldr_scale(1.0f);
//
// (note, do not use _inverse_ constants; stbi_image will invert them
// appropriately).
//
// Additionally, there is a new, parallel interface for loading files as
// (linear) floats to preserve the full dynamic range:
//
//    float *data = stbi_loadf(filename, &x, &y, &n, 0);
//
// If you load LDR images through this interface, those images will
// be promoted to floating point values, run through the inverse of
// constants corresponding to the above:
//
//     stbi_ldr_to_hdr_scale(1.0f);
//     stbi_ldr_to_hdr_gamma(2.2f);
//
// Finally, given a filename (or an open file or memory block--see header
// file for details) containing image data, you can query for the "most
// appropriate" interface to use (that is, whether the image is HDR or
// not), using:
//
//     stbi_is_hdr(char *filename);
//
// ===========================================================================
//
// iPhone PNG support:
//
// We optionally support converting iPhone-formatted PNGs (which store
// premultiplied BGRA) back to RGB, even though they're internally encoded
// differently. To enable this conversion, call
// stbi_convert_iphone_png_to_rgb(1).
//
// Call stbi_set_unpremultiply_on_load(1) as well to force a divide per
// pixel to remove any premultiplied alpha *only* if the image file explicitly
// says there's premultiplied data (currently only happens in iPhone images,
// and only if iPhone convert-to-rgb processing is on).
//
// ===========================================================================
//
// ADDITIONAL CONFIGURATION
//
//  - You can suppress implementation of any of the decoders to reduce
//    your code footprint by #defining one or more of the following
//    symbols before creating the implementation.
//
//        STBI_NO_JPEG
//        STBI_NO_PNG
//        STBI_NO_BMP
//        STBI_NO_PSD
//        STBI_NO_TGA
//        STBI_NO_GIF
//        STBI_NO_HDR
//        STBI_NO_PIC
//        STBI_NO_PNM   (.ppm and .pgm)
//
//  - You can request *only* certain decoders and suppress all other ones
//    (this will be more forward-compatible, as addition of new decoders
//    doesn't require you to disable them explicitly):
//
//        STBI_ONLY_JPEG
//        STBI_ONLY_PNG
//        STBI_ONLY_BMP
//        STBI_ONLY_PSD
//        STBI_ONLY_TGA
//        STBI_ONLY_GIF
//        STBI_ONLY_HDR
//        STBI_ONLY_PIC
//        STBI_ONLY_PNM   (.ppm and .pgm)
//
//   - If you use STBI_NO_PNG (or _ONLY_ without PNG), and you still
//     want the zlib decoder to be available, #define STBI_SUPPORT_ZLIB
//
//  - If you define STBI_MAX_DIMENSIONS, stb_image will reject images greater
//    than that size (in either width or height) without further processing.
//    This is to let programs in the wild set an upper bound to prevent
//    denial-of-service attacks on untrusted data, as one could generate a
//    valid image of gigantic dimensions and force stb_image to allocate a
//    huge block of memory and spend disproportionate time decoding it. By
//    default this is set to (1 << 24), which is 16777216, but that's still
//    very big.

// USAGE
//
//   Include this file in whatever places need to refer to it. In ONE C/C++
//   file, write:
//      #define STB_TRUETYPE_IMPLEMENTATION
//   before the #include of this file. This expands out the actual
//   implementation into that C/C++ file.
//
//   To make the implementation private to the file that generates the implementation,
//      #define STBTT_STATIC
//
//   Simple 3D API (don't ship this, but it's fine for tools and quick start)
//           stbtt_BakeFontBitmap()               -- bake a font to a bitmap for use as texture
//           stbtt_GetBakedQuad()                 -- compute quad to draw for a given char
//
//   Improved 3D API (more shippable):
//           #include "stb_rect_pack.h"           -- optional, but you really want it
//           stbtt_PackBegin()
//           stbtt_PackSetOversampling()          -- for improved quality on small fonts
//           stbtt_PackFontRanges()               -- pack and renders
//           stbtt_PackEnd()
//           stbtt_GetPackedQuad()
//
//   "Load" a font file from a memory buffer (you have to keep the buffer loaded)

//
//   Starting with version 1.06, the rasterizer was replaced with a new,
//   faster and generally-more-precise rasterizer. The new rasterizer more
//   accurately measures pixel coverage for anti-aliasing, except in the case
//   where multiple shapes overlap, in which case it overestimates the AA pixel
//   coverage. Thus, anti-aliasing of intersecting shapes may look wrong. If
//   this turns out to be a problem, you can re-enable the old rasterizer with
//        #define STBTT_RASTERIZER_VERSION 1
//   which will incur about a 15% speed hit.
//
// ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION
//
//   Immediately after this block comment are a series of sample programs.
//
//   After the sample programs is the "header file" section. This section
//   includes documentation for each API function.
//
//   Some important concepts to understand to use this library:
//
//      Codepoint
//         Characters are defined by unicode codepoints, e.g. 65 is
//         uppercase A, 231 is lowercase c with a cedilla, 0x7e30 is
//         the hiragana for "ma".
//
//      Glyph
//         A visual character shape (every codepoint is rendered as
//         some glyph)
//
//      Glyph index
//         A font-specific integer ID representing a glyph
//
//      Baseline
//         Glyph shapes are defined relative to a baseline, which is the
//         bottom of uppercase characters. Characters extend both above
//         and below the baseline.
//
//      Current Point
//         As you draw text to the screen, you keep track of a "current point"
//         which is the origin of each character. The current point's vertical
//         position is the baseline. Even "baked fonts" use this model.
//
//      Vertical Font Metrics
//         The vertical qualities of the font, used to vertically position
//         and space the characters. See docs for stbtt_GetFontVMetrics.
//
//      Font Size in Pixels or Points
//         The preferred interface for specifying font sizes in stb_truetype
//         is to specify how tall the font's vertical extent should be in pixels.
//         If that sounds good enough, skip the next paragraph.
//
//         Most font APIs instead use "points", which are a common typographic
//         measurement for describing font size, defined as 72 points per inch.
//         stb_truetype provides a point API for compatibility. However, true
//         "per inch" conventions don't make much sense on computer displays
//         since different monitors have different number of pixels per
//         inch. For example, Windows traditionally uses a convention that
//         there are 96 pixels per inch, thus making 'inch' measurements have
//         nothing to do with inches, and thus effectively defining a point to
//         be 1.333 pixels. Additionally, the TrueType font data provides
//         an explicit scale factor to scale a given font's glyphs to points,
//         but the author has observed that this scale factor is often wrong
//         for non-commercial fonts, thus making fonts scaled in points
//         according to the TrueType spec incoherently sized in practice.
//
// DETAILED USAGE:
//
//  Scale:
//    Select how high you want the font to be, in points or pixels.
//    Call ScaleForPixelHeight or ScaleForMappingEmToPixels to compute
//    a scale factor SF that will be used by all other functions.
//
//  Baseline:
//    You need to select a y-coordinate that is the baseline of where
//    your text will appear. Call GetFontBoundingBox to get the baseline-relative
//    bounding box for all characters. SF*-y0 will be the distance in pixels
//    that the worst-case character could extend above the baseline, so if
//    you want the top edge of characters to appear at the top of the
//    screen where y=0, then you would set the baseline to SF*-y0.
//
//  Current point:
//    Set the current point where the first character will appear. The
//    first character could extend left of the current point; this is font
//    dependent. You can either choose a current point that is the leftmost
//    point and hope, or add some padding, or check the bounding box or
//    left-side-bearing of the first character to be displayed and set
//    the current point based on that.
//
//  Displaying a character:
//    Compute the bounding box of the character. It will contain signed values
//    relative to <current_point, baseline>. I.e. if it returns x0,y0,x1,y1,
//    then the character should be displayed in the rectangle from
//    <current_point+SF*x0, baseline+SF*y0> to <current_point+SF*x1,baseline+SF*y1).
//
//  Advancing for the next character:
//    Call GlyphHMetrics, and compute 'current_point += SF * advance'.
//
//
// ADVANCED USAGE
//
//   Quality:
//
//    - Use the functions with Subpixel at the end to allow your characters
//      to have subpixel positioning. Since the font is anti-aliased, not
//      hinted, this is very import for quality. (This is not possible with
//      baked fonts.)
//
//    - Kerning is now supported, and if you're supporting subpixel rendering
//      then kerning is worth using to give your text a polished look.
//
//   Performance:
//
//    - Convert Unicode codepoints to glyph indexes and operate on the glyphs;
//      if you don't do this, stb_truetype is forced to do the conversion on
//      every call.
//
//    - There are a lot of memory allocations. We should modify it to take
//      a temp buffer and allocate from the temp buffer (without freeing),
//      should help performance a lot.
//
// NOTES
//
//   The system uses the raw data found in the .ttf file without changing it
//   and without building auxiliary data structures. This is a bit inefficient
//   on little-endian systems (the data is big-endian), but assuming you're
//   caching the bitmaps or glyph shapes this shouldn't be a big deal.
//
//   It appears to be very hard to programmatically determine what font a
//   given file is in a general way. I provide an API for this, but I don't
//   recommend it.
//
//
// PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENTS FOR 1.06:
//
//                      32-bit     64-bit
//   Previous release:  8.83 s     7.68 s
//   Pool allocations:  7.72 s     6.34 s
//   Inline sort     :  6.54 s     5.65 s
//   New rasterizer  :  5.63 s     5.00 s

//      pixel_dist_scale = 180/5.0 = 36.0

//      shape, sample the SDF at each pixel and fill the pixel if the SDF value
//      is greater than or equal to 180/255. (You'll actually want to antialias,
//      which is beyond the scope of this example.) Additionally, you can compute
//      offset outlines (e.g. to stroke the character border inside & outside,
//      or only outside). For example, to fill outside the character up to 3 SDF
//      pixels, you would compare against (180-36.0*3)/255 = 72/255. The above
//      choice of variables maps a range from 5 pixels outside the shape to
//      2 pixels inside the shape to 0..255; this is intended primarily for apply
//      outside effects only (the interior range is needed to allow proper
//      antialiasing of the font at *smaller* sizes)
//
// The function computes the SDF analytically at each SDF pixel, not by e.g.
// building a higher-res bitmap and approximating it. In theory the quality
// should be as high as possible for an SDF of this size & representation, but
// unclear if this is true in practice (perhaps building a higher-res bitmap
// and computing from that can allow drop-out prevention).
//
// The algorithm has not been optimized at all, so expect it to be slow
